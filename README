Overview: In this project I created a simple shell that is able to take in commands, parse those commands, and then run the commands.

I took in the input vector, adjusted it to make sure it was spaced correctly and then passed it into my pare function where it puts all commands and < > characters are the first command in my 2d array of strings. After parsing, I have a for loop that then handles the commands with arguments, handling the functionality of piping, redirection and background. 

Some challenges I ran into was piping. I was closing and opening pipe at the wrong time. To fix this, I remembered that both the parent and child open a pipe and after understanding this it made it easier to implement. Also, making sure I clear my 2d array of strings and the input vector was something I learned I had to do, as it would have input from previous input lines. Additionlly, I struggled with reading input from a file because it took me a while to figure out that I needed to set the file discriptor to stdin, as I was trying to use a pipe. To handle background I passed a variable to check if & was in the input line and if so, I would get rid of the "wait(NULL" and then cleanup the zombie processes using sigchild and sigaction.
